### Describe the feature you'd like:

<!--
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Add any considered
drawbacks.

Note: if you're proposing a new custom matcher, please keep in mind jest-dom's
guiding principles as stated here https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#guiding-principles

In particular, keep this in mind:

> the overall criteria for what is considered a useful custom matcher to add to
> this library, is that doing the equivalent assertion on our own makes the test
> code more verbose, less clear in its intent, and/or harder to read.

A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've
